# How to use this?

Download the repository and extract all files into your project's "Assets" folder.

Follow [the guide](https://compactbunker.org/p/2d-avatar-tutorial/#preparing-the-sprites) from this point until you get to animations, where you can put the avatar together without creating the animations and animation controller yourself.

You still have to create the texture array by yourself.
